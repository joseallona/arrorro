					<h1>Terms of use and Legal Warnings</h1>
					<p>Important: Do not upload TV programs, music, videos, concerts or advertisements without due authorization, unless their contents have been entirely developed by yourself. Do not upload videos that include other people without due authorization.</p>
					<p>Our pages “Advise about Copyrights” and “Instructions of the Community” will help you to determine whether your video is violating the copyrights of another person.</p>
					<p>SIf you click on “Upload videos” you will be stating that the video does not violate the terms of use of ARRORRÓ and that you are the owner of the copyright of such video or that you have been authorized to upload it.</p>
					<h3>Advise about copyrights</h3>
					<p>The publication of material that violates copyrights can lead to financial compensations if the owner of the copyright decides to start legal actions. We will show you, here, some of the guidelines to find out if your video complies with the necessary terms or if it violates the copyright of another person.</p>
					<p>As a general rule, at ARROR&Oacute; we respect the rights of the artists and we surely count on you to help us to abide by the law in our community. By doing so, we will be able to enjoy an experience that will be positive and creative for all of us, including the artists.</p>
					<h2>How can you be sure that your video does not violate other people’s copyright?</h2>
					<p>The best way to be sure is to use your own gifts and abilities to create a completely original video; if it includes other people you should have their authorization before recording or taping them.</p>
					<h2>If all your material is original you will not have to worry about copyrights, because you will hold them</h2>
					<p>The most common reason for us to remove videos is the violation of copyrights: that means that they are direct copies of other people’s work and the holders of the copyright will warn us about the unauthorized use of such contents. The very moment we receive a notification about this unlawful use of a video we immediately proceed to remove it. This is how the copyright law works.</p>
					<h2>What happens if you upload material that violates the copyright law?</h2>
					<p>The very moment when the ARRORR&Oacute; team receives information that a video or any part of it violates the copyright law, it will remove it from the website. If you think that any video violates your own copyright, please send us a notice stating that you are holding those copyrights and we will remove it. If you think that, by mistake, we have removed a video that you have uploaded, please send us due notice that you hold the copyright or that you have been authorized to upload it.</p>
