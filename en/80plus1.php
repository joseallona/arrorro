					<h1>80+1</h1>
					<p class="highlighted">&ldquo;Anything that a person can imagine, another person can make it come true&rdquo;</p>
					<p>During 2009, <a href="http://www.aec.at/" target="_blank" title="Ars Electronica">Ars Electronica</a> and <a href="http://www.voestalpine.com/ag/en.html" target="_blank" title="voestalpine">voestalpine</a> will send the City of Linz on a trip around the world. It will be a virtual adventure that will take place through optical fiber cables and satellite networks typical of the society of information we form part of, in this connected world.</p>  
					<p>These projects will be transmitted via information technologies to Linz, where a panoramic screen will set up in the Hauptplatz (main square) in order to be a “window open to the world”, where people will be able to meet and communicate with people from other parts of the world.</p>
					<h2>20 Themes. 20 Places</h2>
					<p class="lastElement">80+1 examines our future. In Linz and in Europe. Around the world. In 80 days , 80 stops will be made in 20 places all over the world where the future is being created and dominated, or frustrated and destroyed. Journalism and artistic as well as scientific means will be used to analyze key problems regarding our future. We hope to acquire a deeper understanding of our globalised world. </p>
