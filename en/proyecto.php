					<h1>The Project</h1>
					<p class="highlighted">Cities connected in real time. A technological bridge that creates a bond. Different realities. Different time zones. Some are falling asleep, others are waking up. Night and dawn. Lullabies. Songs to wake up. Rhythms and sounds that can be understood beyond languages barriers, distance. </p>
					<p>Arroró. To rock. From a distance. In our own way. In the way our parents taught us. As our grandparents had taught them. Singing. Upholding a tradition that is eternal, beyond time and space.</p>
					<p>Dreams. In the midst of chaos, noise and city stress. Sweet dreams. Singing... Songs get us going, move us, and take us to other places. They take us wherever we want to be. By ourselves or in the company of others. Music that inspires and relaxes. Music that takes us deep into our own selves. </p>
					<h2>Lullabies</h2>
					<p>In every country lullabies are very diverse, because they form part of traditions that are deeply rooted in oral history, history that is always transmitted from parents to children, from generation to generation. The songs a country sings speak about identity; a plural and diverse identity.</p>
					<p>Therefore, the variety of lullabies is an undeniable reality that comes to surface especially because of the influence of the different languages and dialects people speak; this makes them distinctive.</p>
					<p>In Argentina, for example we sing in Spanish, in Gom, in Guarani, in Wichi, in Mapuche, in Russian, Italian, Czechoslovakian, in Bulgarian…</p>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>During three days, between the 23rd and the 25th of July 2009 a live artistic event will take place. Two countries: Austria and Argentina will be united by an online connection with the purpose of exchanging lullabies that are sung in both countries; this will be a celebration of how people can meet and communicate. Cultural diversity and Identity are the principles that guide our Project. This event forms part of the celebration of Linz as the Capital of European Culture - 2009 (<a href="http://www.80plus1.org/" target="_blank" title="80plus1.org">www.80plus1.org</a>).</p>
					<p>This exchange will take place through live performances of the inhabitants of each city and a special program will be broadcasted containing recordings previously prepared in different regions of Argentina.</p>
					<h2>Dynamics</h2>
					<p>During three months we will be traveling to different regions in Argentina to record lullabies sung by their inhabitants.</p>
					<p>At the same time a web site will be designed to contain all these songs. Also web surfers from all over the world will be invited to post their songs.</p>
					<p>This will create an archive-artwork with over 400 people singing, it will have its own special format and will be permanently exhibited online.</p>
